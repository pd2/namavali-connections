This new game is inspired from New York Times' Connections daily word game.

Here is the game concept: You are presented with a grid of 9 jumbled up names of 3 different Hindu gods (given as clues). Your task is to identify each of the 3 groups of 3 names in utmost 4 wrong attempts using up to 3 hints.
